Trump takes office, announced on Thursday that it would nearly double the amount of money it was committing to ward off a potential outbreak of bird flu in humans.

The virus has not yet demonstrated that it can spread efficiently among people.
But should human-to-human transmission become commonplace, experts fear a pandemic that could be far more deadly than Covid-19.
On Thursday, the administration said it was committing $306 million toward improving hospital preparedness, early stage research on therapeutics, diagnostics and vaccines.","['pandemic', 'virus', 'ward', 'officials', 'biden', 'bird', 'million', 'administration', 'prepare', 'committing', 'added', 'potential', 'preparedness', 'outbreak', 'flu', 'spread', 'risk', 'workers', 'money']",2025-01-03,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/02/us/politics/bird-flu-biden-trump.html,The New York Times,https://www.nytimes.com,negative,-0.065,2025-01-03 19:43:00.708819

That raises the possibility a person could get infected with both seasonal flu and H5N1 and the viruses could swap gene segments, Birx said, giving the bird flu virus more tools to better infect humans, a phenomenon known as reassortment.
The patient was likely infected after having contact with sick and dead birds in a backyard flock, the CDC said earlier this month.
“We don’t know what combination of mutations would lead to a pandemic H5N1 virus… but the more humans are infected, the more chances a pandemic virus will emerge.”The CDC has confirmed 65 cases of H5N1 bird flu in humans in 2024.

The debt limit was suspended in June 2023 after a contentious negotiation over federal spending, work requirements for receiving government benefits and funding for the Internal Revenue Service.
That suspension is scheduled to expire on Jan. 2, forcing Treasury to begin using so-called extraordinary measures to allow the federal government to keep paying its bills.
Those measures are essentially accounting maneuvers that keep the government from breaching the debt limit.
They can include suspending certain types of investments in savings plans for government workers and health plans for retired postal workers.","['avoid', 'default', 'warns', 'states', 'using', 'extraordinary', 'limit', 'measures', 'treasury', 'debt', 'spending', 'united', 'yellen', 'workers', 'needed']",2024-12-27,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/27/business/economy/yellen-debt-limit-warning-congress.html,The New York Times,https://www.nytimes.com,negative,-0.105,2025-01-03 19:43:00.708819
