That raises the possibility a person could get infected with both seasonal flu and H5N1 and the viruses could swap gene segments, Birx said, giving the bird flu virus more tools to better infect humans, a phenomenon known as reassortment.
The patient was likely infected after having contact with sick and dead birds in a backyard flock, the CDC said earlier this month.
“We don’t know what combination of mutations would lead to a pandemic H5N1 virus… but the more humans are infected, the more chances a pandemic virus will emerge.”The CDC has confirmed 65 cases of H5N1 bird flu in humans in 2024.
