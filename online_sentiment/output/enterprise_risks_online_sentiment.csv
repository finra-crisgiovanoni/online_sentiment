Metro officials said they posted a warning about the fraudulent text messages on their homepage as soon as they became aware of the scam.

8,Bird Flu,We ‘have our head in the sand’: Health experts warn US isn’t reacting fast enough to threat of bird flu - CNN,"CNN —The US hasn’t learned lessons from the Covid-19 pandemic that it could use to mitigate the threat of pathogens like H5N1 bird flu that keep showing signs of their own pandemic potential, health experts told CNN Friday.
That raises the possibility a person could get infected with both seasonal flu and H5N1 and the viruses could swap gene segments, Birx said, giving the bird flu virus more tools to better infect humans, a phenomenon known as reassortment.
The patient was likely infected after having contact with sick and dead birds in a backyard flock, the CDC said earlier this month.
“We don’t know what combination of mutations would lead to a pandemic H5N1 virus… but the more humans are infected, the more chances a pandemic virus will emerge.”The CDC has confirmed 65 cases of H5N1 bird flu in humans in 2024.

On Thursday, federal health officials reported some unsettling results.
Some of the genetic samples contained mutations that in theory might help the bird flu virus, H5N1, infect people more easily.
One of those mutations was reported last month in a viral sample taken from a teenager with a severe case of bird flu in British Columbia, Canada.
Worrying as those severe cases are, the new report about the Louisiana patient contained some reassuring findings, scientists said.","['genetic', 'bird', 'samples', 'patient', 'louisiana', 'concerning', 'contained', 'reported', 'mutations', 'teenager', 'severe', 'ill', 'health', 'flu']",2024-12-27,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/27/health/bird-flu-mutations-louisiana.html,The New York Times,https://www.nytimes.com,negative,-0.155

The debt limit was suspended in June 2023 after a contentious negotiation over federal spending, work requirements for receiving government benefits and funding for the Internal Revenue Service.
That suspension is scheduled to expire on Jan. 2, forcing Treasury to begin using so-called extraordinary measures to allow the federal government to keep paying its bills.
Those measures are essentially accounting maneuvers that keep the government from breaching the debt limit.
They can include suspending certain types of investments in savings plans for government workers and health plans for retired postal workers.","['spending', 'yellen', 'extraordinary', 'avoid', 'debt', 'limit', 'workers', 'needed', 'warns', 'using', 'united', 'states', 'default', 'treasury', 'measures']",2024-12-27,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/27/business/economy/yellen-debt-limit-warning-congress.html,The New York Times,https://www.nytimes.com,negative,-0.105
