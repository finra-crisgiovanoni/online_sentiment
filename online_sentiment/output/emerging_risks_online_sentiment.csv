15,Quantum Computing,PsiQuantum plans to build one of the world’s first commercially useful quantum computers in Chicago — despite huge obstacles - Chicago Tribune,"But PsiQuantum, the company planning to build in Chicago one of the world’s first commercially viable quantum computers, is taking a different path.
PsiQuantum plans for a dedicated transmission line from ComEd to provide large quantities of carbon-free power for the site.
To create its qubits, PsiQuantum plans to use silicon quantum chips and tiny units of light called photons.
This phenomenon, known as superposition, is harnessed in quantum computers to perform multiple calculations simultaneously.
Another key phenomenon, entanglement, enables quantum computers to link qubits in ways that dramatically enhance computational power and efficiency.","['campus', 'university', 'shadbolt', 'makes', 'computers', 'million', 'takes', 'plans', 'computer', 'shape', 'qubits', 'south', 'psiquantum', 'chicago', 'quantum']",2024-12-26,https://www.chicagotribune.com/2024/12/26/psiquantum-computer-plans/,Chicago Tribune,https://www.chicagotribune.com,positive,+0.098
