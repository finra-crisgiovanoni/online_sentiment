7,2024 Presidential Election,"Venezuela offers $100,000 reward for arrest of exiled opposition candidate - BBC.com","González had vowed to return to Venezuela before President Nicolás Maduro's inauguration next Friday, accusing the government of rigging the vote.
Venezuela's government has offered a $100,000 (£81,000) reward for information leading to the arrest of the opposition's exiled presidential candidate Edmundo González.
The United Nations' Human Rights Committee has ordered Venezuela ""to refrain from destroying"" the voting tallies from the presidential election in July 2024.
The government-aligned National Electoral Council (CNE) declared the incumbent, Maduro, the winner but failed to provide the voting tallies to back up its claim.
González was not well known in Venezuela when he registered as a candidate for the country's presidential election back in March.","['venezuela', 'election', 'presidential', 'voting', 'offers', 'opposition', '100000', 'tallies', 'candidate', 'reward', 'maduro', 'arrest', 'gonzález', 'exiled']",2025-01-03,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr560471ll2o,BBC.com,https://www.bbc.com,negative,-0.099,2025-01-03 19:25:56.403731
15,Quantum Computing,Jim Cramer cautions against speculating on nuclear power and quantum computing - CNBC,"CNBC's Jim Cramer on Thursday warned investors about speculating too heavily in sectors such as nuclear power and quantum computing, saying it may be a long time before either field yields substantial returns.

While quantum computing is legitimate, Cramer said it will also take a long time to scale, and it's ""just a long-term project,"" pointing to ventures in the field from Alphabet .
He said he is concerned about quantum-focused stocks that have run up substantially but are losing money, such as Rigetti Computing , D-Wave Quantum and Quantum Computing .
